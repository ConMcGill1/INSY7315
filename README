# Inventory Management System (Core Three)

## Overview
This project is an **Inventory Management System** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQL Server**.  
It allows an electronics/furniture shop owner to manage products, track price history, search/filter inventory efficiently, and now includes secondary features such as export and advanced search.

## Features Implemented

### Core Features (Sprint 5)
- Add new products (Name, Price, Owner, optional Model & Category)
- View, edit, and delete products
- Search products by Name, Category, or Model
- Track price changes with a Price History table
- Unit and integration tests for core functionality

### Secondary Features (Sprint 7)
- Export product list or price history to **CSV/PDF**
- Price change alerts (notifications when price exceeds a threshold)
- Advanced search filters (by price range, date added, or category)
- Authentication and role-based access (if implemented)
- Regression testing of existing features

## Technology Stack
- **ASP.NET Core MVC 8**
- **Entity Framework Core (Code-First)**
